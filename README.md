**What does it do?**\
This tool simply asks you a question (multiple choice) about your dataset or research design. Based on your answer a second questions is asked (again in multiple choice). This continues until are relevant information is gathered (maximum of 7 questions) about your dataset and research design to tell you which hypothesis test is the correct one for your project. 

**Is it fast?**  
Yes. It is all JavaScript so each new question does not require a pageload. You load the page once, and that is all.
